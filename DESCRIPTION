Description: Provides a step-down procedure for controlling the False
  Discovery Proportion (FDP) in a competition-based setup, implementing 
  Dong et al. (2020) <arXiv:2011.11939>. Such setups include target-decoy 
  competition (TDC) in computational mass spectrometry and the knockoff 
  construction in linear regression.
